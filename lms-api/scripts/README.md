# LMSHub LMS - Database Seeding Scripts

This directory contains comprehensive mock data seeding scripts to help you quickly set up your LMSHub LMS project with realistic sample data.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To seed your database with all sample data, simply run:

```bash
npm run seed:all
```

This will create:

- System roles with proper permissions (Super Admin, Admin, Student, Guest)
- Course categories (5 samples)
- Sample users (5 samples with Student and Guest roles)
- Admin user account
- Sample courses (5 courses without detailed chapters/lessons)

├── README.md                 # This documentation
├── create-admin-user.ts      # Admin user creation

```

## 🔄 Execution Order

When running `npm run seed:all`, the scripts execute in this order:

1. **Roles** - Creates the permission system foundation
2. **Categories** - Sets up course categorization
3. **Users** - Creates sample users (requires roles)
4. **Admin User** - Creates the main admin account (requires roles)
5. **Courses** - Creates courses with content (requires categories and users)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Cleanup

- Each script clears existing data before creating new records
- The master script (`seed:all`) will completely reset your database
- Always backup important data before running seeding scripts

### Development vs Production

- These scripts are designed for development and testing
- **DO NOT** run seeding scripts in production environments
- The sample data includes test accounts with known passwords

### Customization

- You can modify the sample data in each script to fit your needs
- Add more courses, users, or categories by editing the respective files
- Adjust permissions by modifying the roles configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**

   ```
   Error: Failed to connect to MongoDB
   ```

   **Solution**: Check your `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` and ensure MongoDB is running

2. **Permission Errors**

   ```
   Error: Role 'Admin' not found
   ```

   **Solution**: Run `npm run seed:roles` first, or use `npm run seed:all`

3. **Duplicate Key Errors**
   ```
   Error: E11000 duplicate key error
   ```
   **Solution**: The script should handle cleanup, but you can manually clear collections if needed

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all prerequisites are met
2. Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured
3. Try running individual scripts to isolate the problem
4. Check the console output for specific error messages

## 🎯 Next Steps

After successful seeding:

1. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as Admin**:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123456`

3. **Explore Sample Data**:
   - Browse courses and categories
   - Test user roles and permissions
   - Review the course content structure

4. **Customize for Your Needs**:
   - Modify existing courses
   - Add your own content
   - Adjust user roles and permissions
   - Update branding and styling
